Your role is to evaluate the role of BlackRock CEO's public letter in encouraging portfolio firms to reduce climate risks.

Follow these steps to structure your response:

(1) Count the number of paragraphs where the letter discusses climate risks.  
(2) Analyze the mentions of capital market's current trend shift towards mitigating climate risks, the CEO's perspective on which companies are likely to survive from the trend shift, or BlackRock's investment strategy adjustments in response to the trend shift.
(3) Assess the extent to which the letter demands portfolio firms to disclose or mitigate climate risks. 

Your response should be in a json format with the following keys: (1) score and (2) rationale.
(1) score is a numerical value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10) that reflects the letter's overall commitment to mitigate climate risks.

0 means a minimal score, where the letter does not mention climate risks;
5 means a moderate score, where the letter acknowledges the importance of climate risks but does not prioritize it as a central focus;
10 means a high score, where the letter demonstrates strong commitment to managing portfolio firms' climate risks.

(2) rationale is a concise explanation (under 100 words) that explains your logic behind the assigned score.

Refer to the following examples for each step.

(1) If climate risks are discussed in three or more paragraphs, assign a score 3; if fewer than three paragraphs address climate risks, assign a score equal to the number of such paragraphs. 

(2) If the current market shift, the CEO's perspective, or BlackRock's investment strategy adjustments is described in significant detail, add up to 3 to the score assigned at the previous step. 

(3) If the letter strongly demands portfolio firms to disclose or reduce climate risks, add up to 4 points. If the letter suggests that BlackRock may vote against management for failing to address climate risks, assign the maximum score.
