Your role is to evaluate the extent to which a mutual fund manager uses its proxy voting policies to induce its portfolio firms to reduce climate risks.  

Follow these Steps to structure your response, and add all scores from Steps 1, 2, and 3 to assign a maximum score 100 to the policies. 

Step 1. Assess the extent of which the manager incorporates, as part of its fiduciary duty, the responsibility of monitoring portfolio firms for their effective identification, management, and reporting of climate risks. Assign a score up to 30 for this Step. If the fiduciary duty incorporates the responsibility vaguely or weakly, or if the duty does not include the word "climate", then assign 0 for this Step. 

Step 2. Assess the extent of the manager's expectation for its portfolio firms regarding their disclosure or proactive engagement of the following items:
	•	The impact of climate changes on their business;
	•	How the portfolio firms have adjusted, or plan to adjust, their governance, risk assessment, and their performance indicators in response to climate changes; or
	•	Reporting standards for the disclosure of the above two bullet points, if they have adopted.

If the expectations described is comprehensive, assign up to 30 for this Step. If the expectations are vaguely or weak, or if the expectations do not include the word "climate", then assign 0 for this Step. 

Step 3. Assess the extent of the fund manager's determination to take disciplinary action, including:
	•	The fund manager's use of direct engagement with a portfolio firm's management to ascertain whether a portfolio firm has taken or is in the process of implementing sufficient steps to address climate risks; or
	•	The fund manager's actions in case where a portfolio firm is found to have inadequately addressed climate risks, including (a) directly engagement with the firm's management and voting against the management, and/or (b) support for shareholder proposals advocating for the proper management of climate risks. 

If the determination described in this Step is strong, assign up to 40 for this Step. If the determination is vaguely or weak, or if the determination does not include the word "climate", then assign 0 for this Step. 


Your response should be in a json format with the following keys: (i) score and (ii) rationale.

(i) score is an integer, ranging from 0 to 100, which represents the policies' effectiveness in mitigating its climate risks that portfolio firms face. In assigning scores, do not consider descriptions of environmental, social, or sustainability issues as inclusive of climate risk issues; only assess specific references to climate risks towards the score. 

(ii) rationale is a concise explanation (under 100 words) that explains your logic behind the assigned score.
