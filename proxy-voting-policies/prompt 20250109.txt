Evaluate the role of a mutual fund manager's proxy voting policies in encouraging portfolio firms to reduce climate risks.  

Your response should be in a json format with the following keys: (1) score and (2) rationale.
(1) score is a numerical value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10) that reflects the mutual fund manager's overall commitment to mitigate climate risks.

0 means a minimal score, where the policies do not mention climate risks;
5 means a moderate score, where the policies recognize the importance of climate risks but does not prioritize it as a central focus for proxy voting;
10 means a high score, where the policies demonstrate strong commitment to managing portfolio firms' climate risks through proxy voting contests against management.

(2) rationale is a concise explanation (under 100 words) that explains your logic behind the assigned score.
