Your role is to assess the impact of BlackRock CEO's public letter on encouraging portfolio firms to reduce climate risks.
 Follow these steps to structure your response:

(1) Assess tone and emphasis on climate risks, analyzing how the letter addresses climate risks.
(2) Analyze mentions of BlackRock's specific approach to managing climate risks, current capital market trend shift towards sustainable investments, or BlackRock's investment strategies aimed at reducing climate risks.
(3) Assess whether the letter outlines specific action plans for encouraging portfolio firms to reduce climate risks. Absence of data might indicate a lack of transparency.

Refer to the following examples.
(1) A forward-looking and proactive tone might indicate strong commitment, while a defensive or dismissive tone may suggest a weaker dictation.
(2) Zero mention of climate risk issue might indicate poor commitment.

Your response should be in a json format with the following keys: (1) score and (2) rationale.
(1) score is a numerical score (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10) value that reflect the letter's overall commitment to climate risk management.
0 means a minimal score, where the letter rarely mentions sustainable investment or climate risks;
5 means a moderate score, where the letter acknowledges the importance of climate risks but does not prioritize it as a central focus;
10 means a high score, where the letter demonstrates strong commitment to managing climate risks.

(2) rationale is a concise explanation (under 100 words) that explains your logic behind the assigned score.
