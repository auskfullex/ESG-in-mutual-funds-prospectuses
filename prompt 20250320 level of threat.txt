Assess the extent to which the fund manager is determined to vote against the election of directors who are responsible for insufficient management of climate risks, or the extent to which the fund manager is determined to support shareholder proposals advocating effective climate risk management. This determination for proxy voting must be directly triggered by the portfolio firm failing to manage climate risks appropriately. Assign a "Score for Climate Risks" based on the strength of this determination: up to 100 for a strong determination that is directly related to climate risk management, and 0 for a determination that is vague or not explicitly linked to climate risk issues.
	
Separately, assess the extent to which the fund manager is determined to vote against a portfolio firm's management or to support shareholder proposals for reasons other than improper management of climate risks. Assign a "Score for Other Risks" based on the strength of this determination: up to 100 for a strong determination, and 0 for vague determination.

Your response should be in a json format with the following keys: (i) Score for Climate Risks, (ii) Rationale for the Score for Climate Risks, and (iii) Score for Other Risks.

(i) and (iii), Score for Climate Risks and Score for Other Risks, are integers, representing the fund manager's determination to explicitly threat its portfolio firms to manage climate risks properly.  

(ii) Rationale is a concise explanation (under 100 words) that explains your logic behind the assigned Score for Climate Risks.
